# sparklestick

Self-contained LED effects for the Raspberry Pi Zero, written in Go.

## Overview

Pair a Raspberry Pi Zero with a couple of other pieces of hardware, and create a tiny self-contained sparkle machine not much larger than a stick of gum. You'll need the following items:

* [Scroll pHAT HD](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd) - also available on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3473).
* [Button SHIM](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/button-shim) - also available on [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3582).

*Build guide coming soon...*

Although you can deploy the software to the Pi manually, it's highly recommended to use [resin.io](https://resin.io) for easy deployment and upgrades.
