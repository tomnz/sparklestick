## Reporting an issue

If you've found a bug or have a feature request, please browse the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/tomnz/sparklestick/issues) to see if anyone else has already reported. If not, submit a new issue!

## Submitting a Pull Request

- Fork the project on GitHub.
- Make any changes you wish against your fork, ideally against a branch.
- Check out the README for a detailed guide on installing and modifying the source code.
- Ensure that your changes meet the coding standards - i.e. `gofmt`/`golint`/`go test` all pass.
- [Submit a PR upstream](https://github.com/tomnz/button-shim-go/pull/new/master). Be as descriptive as possible about the problem you're solving, and how you've solved it.
- Chill. Someone will be by shortly!
